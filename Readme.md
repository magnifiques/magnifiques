#  Hey there! I'm Arpit üê±‚ÄçüöÄ

## I'm a curious developer and builder who started with web development and UI/UX design. Now I‚Äôm diving into the world of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Generative AI. I love turning ideas into amazing projects, whether it‚Äôs a 3D website or a smart machine learning model that identifies the breed of a dog.


### ‚ö™ List of my projects that have been created and deployed by me:

## WhatToCookToday üç≥

### The Website link: [WhatToCookToday](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vapit/whattocooktoday).

- Built a smart recipe recommendation system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search to match user-input ingredients with 180K+ real-world recipes.

- Implemented dense vector search with SentenceTransformers and ChromaDB, enabling real-time, context-aware recipe suggestions without relying on keyword matching.

- Designed a fully CPU-compatible pipeline, optimizing for low-resource environments by avoiding model fine-tuning and using lightweight, pre-trained embeddings.

- Preprocessed and normalized a large-scale recipe dataset (Food.com), handling data cleaning, formatting, and conversion into LangChain-compatible documents.

- Deployed an interactive cooking assistant UI on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio, supporting natural language ingredient input and seamless user interaction.


## Breemary üêù

### The Website link: [Breemary](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vapit/breemmary).

- Fine-tuned Meta‚Äôs BART-Large-CNN model on a custom dataset of emails and conversational texts to generate high-quality, context-aware summaries, achieving a ROUGE-1 score of 57, ROUGE-2 score of 33, and ROUGE-L score of 48.

- Employed Accelerate for mixed-precision training and multi-GPU support, optimizing model training on limited hardware resources. Designed efficient data preprocessing, batching, and augmentation pipelines to train on 15,000 text samples, ensuring diverse and generalized performance.

- Integrated linear learning rate scheduling with warmup and AdamW optimizer to stabilize training and improve convergence.

- Published and version-controlled the trained model on Hugging Face Hub using Gradio, making it publicly accessible for real-world text summarization tasks.

## Dogvision üê∂

### The Website link: [Foodvision](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vapit/DogVision).


- Developed a high-speed, lightweight dog breed classification model using PyTorch, trained on 120 unique dog breeds from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification dataset.

- Implemented transfer learning with top-performing vision models (ConvNext Tiny, ViT-B-16, MaxVit-Tiny), refining performance on a dataset of 10,000 images. ConvNext Tiny was selected for its balance between accuracy and efficiency, achieving 97% accuracy and a 95% F1-score.

- Applied data augmentation techniques and a learning rate scheduler to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting, optimizing model performance.

- Deployed the model on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio, enabling real-time user testing and interaction.

## Foodvision üçî

### The Website link: [Foodvision](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vapit/foodvision_extended).

- Built a food classification model using PyTorch and the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, utilizing PyTorch‚Äôs torchvision library for transfer learning with pre-trained weights. The model was trained for 20 epochs, achieving an overall accuracy of 86.32%, with 20 food categories from the Food101 dataset.

- To improve the model‚Äôs generalization and prevent overfitting, Applied data augmentation (flipping, rotating images) and used a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate over time. Early stopping was also implemented to avoid overtraining the model.

- Deployed the model using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing live testing and interaction with the extended classification model, making it accessible for anyone to try.
